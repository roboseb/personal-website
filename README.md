# Personal Website

--Devlog--

October 25th, 2022

    Sorta got my Odin-Book project done, so here we go with this one. Spent most of the day reading a bunch of the assigned articles, so I've really only got about three days to do this in the time frame I set up. Regardless, the site is basically hard coded data with no fanciness added on top, and it won't be nearly as customized as my last portfolio. Oh yeah, the outline says to make this a personal website, but I think that basically just means, "Do the portfolio again, since you fucked it up so bad last time."

    By the way, last few days have been powered by the excellent POW! Right in the kisser! by Hail the Sun. Audio is for some reason really quiet on the album, but it's great. Their first two releases are very different from the later stuff that came after they were signed, but the later stuff is also good. First song on this album is about doing heroin. My arm is thirsty!

    Main outline for this portfolio is an idea of mine from a few months back. When it first loads in , it looks like plain html that hasn't loaded the CSS properly. Then, when you interact with it in any way, it smoothly springs to life to some sort of sexy modern layout.

    Two full days, and then maybe a half day. Seems pretty reasonable.

    Lost a game of Hearthstone in legend today because my phone is ass. Literally missed out on swinging with a minion with 32 attack cause my phone just said to me, "Not today!"

    So technically one day left. I don't think I'll have this done to a satisfactory level within that timeframe, so I'll just add it to the other projects I need clean up early next month.
