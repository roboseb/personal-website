# Personal Website

--Devlog--

October 25th, 2022

    Sorta got my Odin-Book project done, so here we go with this one. Spent most of the day reading a bunch of the assigned articles, so I've really only got about three days to do this in the time frame I set up. Regardless, the site is basically hard coded data with no fanciness added on top, and it won't be nearly as customized as my last portfolio. Oh yeah, the outline says to make this a personal website, but I think that basically just means, "Do the portfolio again, since you fucked it up so bad last time."

    By the way, last few days have been powered by the excellent POW! Right in the kisser! by Hail the Sun. Audio is for some reason really quiet on the album, but it's great. Their first two releases are very different from the later stuff that came after they were signed, but the later stuff is also good. First song on this album is about doing heroin. My arm is thirsty!

    Main outline for this portfolio is an idea of mine from a few months back. When it first loads in , it looks like plain html that hasn't loaded the CSS properly. Then, when you interact with it in any way, it smoothly springs to life to some sort of sexy modern layout.

    Two full days, and then maybe a half day. Seems pretty reasonable.

    Lost a game of Hearthstone in legend today because my phone is ass. Literally missed out on swinging with a minion with 32 attack cause my phone just said to me, "Not today!"

    So technically one day left. I don't think I'll have this done to a satisfactory level within that timeframe, so I'll just add it to the other projects I need clean up early next month.

    Short holiday over. Now to finish up the personal website so that I can start applying to jobs. Found an online svg editor that I think I can use to make my icons fit with eachother a bit better.

    Tired.

    Less tired.

    I think the rolodex is almost done, which is nice. My past projects are mostly digitized, outside of having the repo/live links. There is however a noticible error in my math when scrolling a few times in the same direction, where the entire rolodex starts to rotate excessively backwards, which I will probably need to fix first thing today. Then I just need to come up with a cute section for technologies, and decide what I want on the final contact page. Maybe a section to email me.

    I believe the issue with the rolodex related to some rounding at some point during the process. So I just did a bit of math at the begginning, and now all the numbers start as whole, removing the problem. Works and looks great. Still not sure how I would clean up the z-index stuff. Still not sure why the cards aren't just stacked properly since they're in 3D space, but whatever.

    Rolodex is done, and it looks pretty great.

    Met two web developers on omegle last night. One didn't seems particularly insightful, but the other took a look at this project. He seemed to think the rolodex was pretty cool, which was my intent, but he also looked at Discord Instant Messenger and mentioned that it would be more informative to a potential employer. Also mentioned figma, and that if I can recreate UIs from mock-ups, that's pretty valuable. Also we tested the site with devtools' lighthouse, and the performance was shit, which was mostly expected. This portfolio is not practical, but instead more of a cute little showcase of the kinds of things I can make.

    Many collectable toys come with a small sheet listing all available toys in a given set. My technology section is gonna be one of those, with each framework or library being a little funko pop ripoff guy.

    Back at it again. Contact page is the last big thing to get done, then just some minor additions throughout. Contact page should be easily done today, and then with the rest of the day and all of tomorrow it might be looking pretty good. Definitely took longer than I thought, but even now it looks pretty dope.

    Last day? Who knows, but we'll see. Hoping I can quickly fix the text blur issue on some elements, as that's one of the most annoying things left. Then to start finishing up some items from the to-do list.
